        <h2 className="text-teal font-serif">Preparing and Submitting Your Papers:</h2>
        Papers have to be submitted via the <a class="no-underline text-teal hover:font-bold" href="https://easychair.org/conferences/?conf=iot2019" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">EasyChair conference system</a>, must be written in English and contain original material that has not been published or is currently undergoing review elsewhere. Papers should not exceed 8 pages, including figures and references. 
        <br /><br />The paper layout should follow the <a class="no-underline text-teal hover:font-bold" href="https://www.acm.org/publications/proceedings-template" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">ACM SIGCHI Conference format</a>. 
        Papers will be peer-reviewed by three experts of the scientific committee following a single-blind review process (i.e. identity of the reviewer is anonymous, but the authorâ€™s name and affiliation are on the paper). The papers will be selected based on technical novelty, integrity of the analysis, and practical relevance and impact. 
        <br />Accepted papers will be listed on DBLP and should be published via the ACM Digital Library. Cases of plagiarism or multiple submissions will be subject to disciplinary action as per ACM rules and regulations, and no-shows at the conference will result in  exclusion from the ACM Digital Library. Selected papers will be invited to extend and improve their contributions to  Special Issues under consideration.
