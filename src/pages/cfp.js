        Driven by connected low-cost sensing and actuation and the large host of scientifically and economically relevant application scenarios that they enable, 
        the Internet of Things has become a central research area with a broad reach across many fields in information technology and adjacent domains.
        The <strong>International Conference on Internet of Things </strong> (IoT) has become the premier gathering place where visionary, ground-breaking research in the IoT field meets leading industry experts. 
        Since its beginnings in the year 2008, IoT has been backed by strong support from leading academic institutions as well as industry and we are happy to announce its 9th
        iteration will take place from October 22-25th 2018 in Bilbao, Spain.
