      <h1>Work-in-Progress and Demo sessions</h1>
      The objective of the WiPs and demo sessions is to give researchers in the emerging research areas of IoT and their applications the opportunity to present early and fresh, in-progress results in order to share experiences and strategies whilst facilitating the discussion between authors and conference attendees.

<br />
<br />
The topic of this year edition will be Internet of Things for People which encompasses all the applications and ground-breaking work that is being done in the IoT field to pave the bridge between citizens and everywhere data produced by pervasive technology.

In general terms, IoT 2019 is seeking for works on all topics related to the development and social adoption of the Internet of Things.  Recommended topics of submission are as follows, but not limited to.

        <h2>Preparing and Submitting Your Papers:</h2>
        Papers have to be submitted via the EasyChair conference system, must be written in English and contain original material that has not been published or is currently undergoing review elsewhere. Papers should not exceed 8 pages, including figures and references. The paper layout should follow the SIGCHI Conference format. Papers are peer-reviewed by a committee of experts in the IoT field and selected based on technical novelty, integrity of the analysis, and practical relevance and impact. Accepted papers will be listed on DBLP and published via the ACM Digital Library. Cases of plagiarism or multiple submissions will be subject to disciplinary action as per ACM rules and regulations, and no-shows at the conference will result in an exclusion from the ACM Digital Library. Selected papers will be invited to extend and improve their contributions to  Special Issues under consideration.
