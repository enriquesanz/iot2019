              The University of Deusto was inaugurated in 1886.  The central headquarters of the University of Deusto is located on the opposite side of the estuary, facing the Bilbao Guggenheim Museum, an emblematic symbol of the significant transformation of Bilbao during the last three decades.

           <h2 className="text-teal"> About the city </h2>
              
              Nowadays, Bilbao is the centre of a metropolitan area with more than one million inhabitants, a city traditionally open to Europe. Bilbao is a city with plenty of charisma and personality; traditional and avantgarde at the same time. From the narrow streets of the Casco Viejo [Old Town] to the Gran VÃ­a and the New Bilbao, there is a whole world of history and legends that have turned the small port on the banks of the river into a world benchmark. A friendly space for those who are interested in innovation, architecture, art, technology, design, leisure, gastronomy and culture.
