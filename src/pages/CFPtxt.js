2nd Call for Papers (New deadline, June 16, 2019, 23:59, AoE)<br /> 
9th International Conference on the Internet of Things (IoT 2019)<br />
http://iot-conference.org<br />
University of Deusto. Bilbao, Spain<br />
ACM (SIGCHI) In-Cooperation event<br />
=================================================================<br /><br />

With the advent of digitalization and communicating physical objects such as machines and vehicles, the Internet of Things (IoT) has become an exciting field of research encompassing pervasive computing, cyber-physical systems, and information and communication technologies. Particular challenges include the understanding of IoT application demands and novel network traffic types, low-latency and reliable communication, and integrating and mediating Things within intelligent systems, where IoT technologies are potential catalysts. In addition, a better understanding of impending social and societal impacts is vital to the success of the IoT.<br /><br />

Topics of Interest<br />
==================<br />
IoT 2019 solicits original, high impact research papers on all topics related to the development and adoption of the Internet of Things – topics of interest include, but are not limited to:<br /><br />

• IoT Edge and Cloud Architectures<br />
• Web of Things<br />
• AI and Machine Learning for the IoT<br />
• IoT Communication Technologies<br />
• Interacting with the IoT<br />
• Societal impact of the IoT<br />
• Energy Efficiency and Sustainability in the IoT<br />
• Sensing, Signal Processing, Actuation and Analytics<br />
• Security, Privacy and Trust in the IoT<br />
• Real-world Applications, Deployments, and Testbeds<br /><br />

Submission Information<br />
======================<br />
Papers must be submitted via the EasyChair (https://easychair.org/conferences/?conf=iot2019) conference system, written in English and contain original material that has not been published or is currently undergoing review elsewhere. Papers should not exceed 8 pages, short papers are limited to 4 pages, including figures and references. The paper layout should follow the ACM SIGCHI conference format. Papers will be peer-reviewed by three experts from the technical program committee following a single-blind review process (i.e., the identity of the reviewer is hidden, but the author’ names and affiliations should be included in the submission). The papers will be selected based on technical novelty, integrity of the analysis, and practical relevance and potential impact. Accepted papers will be listed on DBLP and published via the ACM Digital Library. Cases of plagiarism or multiple submissions will be subject to disciplinary action as per ACM rules and regulations, and no-shows at the conference will result in an exclusion from the ACM Digital Library. Authors of selected papers will be invited to extend their contributions for inclusion in journal special issues.<br /><br />
